# FinFET and TCAD Models {#finfets}

The FinFET is an advanced transistor architecture commonly used in modern computer chips, and has been continuously used in state-of-the-art processors since their first commercial deployment in the Intel Ivy Bridge chips in 2012. The FinFET architecture has been in use for a variety of modern process nodes, such as the Intel 4 node, and the TSMC N3 node.

In order to predict the behavior of future scaled transistors and obtain physical insights to their operation to aid research and development, physics-based technology CAD \(TCAD\) simulations are important. Compared to fitted models such as BSIM-CMG and alike, TCAD models allows one to examine spatially distributed microscopic quantities such as charge and current, at the cost of slower run speed, which forbids their integration into large scale circuit simulators.
