# Simulation Setup {#transistor_physics}

Basic transport in the transistor is handled by a modified drift-diffusion equation in conjunction with the usual Poisson's equation. Field-dependent Caughey-Thomas electron mobility and quantum confinement via the modified local density approximation \(MLDA\) have been implemented on top of the well-known drift-diffusion equation.
