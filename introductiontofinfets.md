# Introduction {#introductiontofinfets}

This project contains a COMSOL Multiphysics model for a fin field-effect transistor \(FinFET\), freely available for personal and research use. This documentation aims to help users in using and modifying this model for their purposes by providing details regarding physics contained in the model, numerical details, and basic results.

Thus far, versions of this model has been successfully used in two papers published in the *IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices,* demonstrating its potency. While formal justifications of the choice of model parameters have been discussed in these published works, this documentation will serve as a manual-style resource for users to use and tune the model for their own personal or research projects.

Please note that parts of this documentation is still being updated and subject to change.
