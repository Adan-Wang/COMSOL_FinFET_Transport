# Basic Description

COMSOL simulation of carrier transport of a 7-nm FinFET.

Implemented custom solution to model quantum confinement effects using the Modified Local Density Approximation [1].

Its performance and comparison with experimental device can be seen in [2]. Further documentation of methodologies are in progress.

Please note that this file will ONLY run on COMSOL 5.4 in its current configuration.
