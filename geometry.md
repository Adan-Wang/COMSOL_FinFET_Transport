# Geometry {#geometry}

The FinFET transistor model is in 2-D, representing the top view of a single fin. The simulation domain is surrounded by air to accommodate stray fields that will otherwise be out of bounds of the transistor domain itself.

This particular model is modeled after the a 7-nm device. Details of the justifications of these parameters can be found in [this](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9830782/) published paper.

|Parameter|Value|
|---------|-----|
|Gate Length|16 nm|
|Fin Width|5.5 nm|
|Fin Height|50 nm|
|Spacer Length|6.5 nm|
|Oxide Thickness|4 nm|
