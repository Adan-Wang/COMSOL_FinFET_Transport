# Mobility {#mobility}

The only non-constant mobility model utilized in this simulation is the Caughey-Thomas field-dependent mobility model. As an acceptable match with experimental results of similar process node was achieved by only tuning parameters of this model, no further refinement was conducted.

The Caughey-Thomas model equation is as follows
